        excerpt: 'How to bring warmth into minimalist interiors using texture, tone, and light.',
        content: `
            <p>Minimalism is more than clean lines and empty shelves. The most livable minimalist homes balance <strong>breathing space</strong> with layers of <strong>texture</strong> and <strong>natural materials</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Start with a restrained palette</h3>
            <p>Choose three base tones and stay consistent. Add warmth using wood, linen, and matte finishes.</p>
            <h3>Design for light</h3>
            <p>Use sheer drapery, low-profile fixtures, and wall washers to soften shadows and enhance depth.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote">Simplicity is the frame. Comfort is the story inside it.</blockquote>
            <p>Finish with greenery and tactile accents—wool throws, boucle upholstery, raw ceramics. The space feels quiet but never cold.</p>

        excerpt: 'Work triangles are old news. Zones for prep, cooking, plating, and cleanup keep the rhythm smooth.',
        content: `
            <p>Zones make kitchens effortless. Keep prep tools near the sink, heat-safe drawers by the cooktop, and a landing zone beside the fridge.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dedicated prep counter with task lighting</li>
                <li>Drawer organizers for knives and daily tools</li>
                <li>Pantry pull-outs near the refrigerator</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finish with durable surfaces and lighting layers—ambient, task, and accent.</p>

        excerpt: 'Use vertical lines, oversized art, and reflective surfaces to expand perception.',
        content: `
            <p>Go taller, not wider: vertical millwork and long curtains lift the eye. A large piece of art feels intentional and reduces visual clutter.</p>
            <p>Mirrors across from windows double the daylight while soft rugs and warm lamps prevent sterility.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Materials with texture and history—oak, terrazzo, brushed metal—improve as they patinate. We design for longevity, not novelty.</p>
            <p>Pair cool stones with warm woods and matte finishes to achieve balance.</p>
